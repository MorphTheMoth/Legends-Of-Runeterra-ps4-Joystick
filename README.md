# Legends-Of-Runeterra-with-Joystick

i tried to make a python script that would transform a joystick input into mouse and keyboard inputs, to play [Legends Of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/it-it/); a card game made by Riot Games.


it works pretty well, the only problem is that i noticed that if i approached the problem in a completely different way, it would have been both better to use and easier to implement, so i lost interest in continuing it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

for now it only works with a ps4 controller.

### how to use
 - in the game, go to settings -> third party tools -> enable third party endpoints, the port should be 21337
 - download the zip by clicking the green 'code' button on the top right
 - [download python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't already have it
 - double click the 'lor.py' file


### commands:
 - square: attack / defend / use a card
 - cross: (left click in the menu) / 
 - Triangle: end turn
 - Circle: undo attack / undo defend / undo spell
